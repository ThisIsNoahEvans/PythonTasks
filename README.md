# PythonTasks (WIP)
A collection of tasks and projects Iâ€™ve completed at school during Computer Science lessons on Python

## Important
These are simply Python tasks I've completed at school. I don't intend to maintain these other than uploading new tasks when I complete them.

The code may not be very elegant, as I prefer to just get the work done rather than work as hard as I would on a personal project. 

Please don't create pull requests or file issues on GitHub: they'll be ignored.
